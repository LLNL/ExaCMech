abstractNote = {{SNLS} (small non-linear solver) is a C++ library for solving non-linear systems. The emphasis is on small systems of equations for which direct factorization of the Jacobian is appropriate. The systems of equations may be numerically ill-conditioned. Implementation is amenable to {GPU} usage, with the idea that class instantiation would occur within device functions.},
